      <h1>What is Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
      <p>
      The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo, and is one of the more popular time management techniques.
      The technique traditionally has working sessions of about 25 minutes followed by breaks of 4-5 minutes. Every fourth break is supposed to be a longer break of about 10-15 minutes.
      The technique is called 'Pomodoro' as Cirillo used a Pomodoro-shaped (tomato-shaped) kitchen timer during his university days.

      <h1>How Does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        The technique consists of 6 steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Set the task</li>
          <li>Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).</li>
          <li>Work on the task.</li>
          <li>End work when the timer rings and put a checkmarkr.</li>
          <li>If one has fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; else continue to the next step.</li>
          <li>After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </div>

      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is the interval of time spent working.<br>
        Regular breaks are taken, a short (3–5 minutes) rest separates consecutive
        pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15–30 minute) rest is taken between sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any time remains after completion of the task using the Pomodoro technique, then it can be devoted to activities like:
        <ul>
          <li>Review and edit the work just completed.</li>
          <li>Review the activities from a learning point of view: What did I learn? What could I do better or differently?</li>
          <li>Review the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned Pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating those tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
