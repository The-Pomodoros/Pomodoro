# Pomodoro - A Productivity Timer
## Introduction
The website aims to provide a Pomodoro Technique based timer to its users for better time management and hence increase their productivity. The main target audience for the website comprises students who often find it difficult to concentrate on studying for a long period.<br>
The technique traditionally has working sessions of about 25 minutes followed by breaks of 4-5 minutes. Every fourth break is supposed to be a longer break of about 10-15 minutes. The technique is called 'Pomodoro' as the developer of the technique, Francesco Cirillo used a Pomodoro-shaped kitchen timer during his university days.
